        <h2>Hello! I'm Maseabata “Pearl” Matata</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and dynamic events planner who brings creativity, empathy, and precision to every celebration I design. My journey started with 2 years as a flower arranger, followed by 5 years of waitressing—where I learned the power of hospitality. I then transitioned into mixology for 2 years, and I’m still expanding my craft every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a degree in Public Relations and am currently pursuing my degree in Professional Communication. My strong communication skills, paired with industry experience, allow me to bring people together through storytelling, vibrant designs, and seamless event coordination.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in freelance marketing, advertising, and event planning—helping both individuals and companies achieve their goals with elegance and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not planning events, you’ll find me reading, experimenting with creative ideas, or finding inspiration in everyday moments. I'm driven by the desire to create memorable experiences and build lasting connections through my work.
